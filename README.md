GroupProject_Team88+3

This is the final group project made during the PeopleCert's coding bootcamp. It is a 3-tier web application which simulates a Coffee shopâ€™s website in which: 
 - One can register and log in as a customer, go through the menu which includes a variety of coffees. They can also pick, fully customize and add their favorite products to their personal cart and finally place their order by paying online via PayPal or paying at the store.
 - The Owner of the Coffee Shop can customize (CRUD operations) the products they sell.
 - There is an internal real time communication between customers (whether they have registered as users or not) and admins.
